\title{
MCMC estimation for stochastic volatility models with leverage
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
This function estimates model parameters and latent log volatilities for 
stochastic volatility models with leverage (asymmetric stochastic volatility models):  

y(t) = eps(t)*exp(h(t)/2), h(t+1) = mu + phi*(h(t)-mu) + eta(t)

eps(t)~i.i.d. N(0,1), eta(t)~i.i.d. N(0,sigma_eta^2)

where we assume the correlation between eps(t) and eta(t) equals to rho. Prior distributions are 


mu~N(mu_0,sigma_0^2), (phi+1)/2~Beta(a_0,b_0), sigma_eta^2~IG(n_0/2,S_0/2),

(rho+1)/2~Beta(a_1,b_1),


where N, Beta and IG denote normal, beta and inverse gaussian distributions respectively. Note that the probability density function of x ~ IG(a,b) is proportional to (1/x)^(a+1)*exp(-b/x). 

The highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is based on the mixture 
sampler by Omori, Chib, Shephard and Nakajima (2007), but it further corrects 
the approximation error within the sampling algorithm.
See Takahashi, Omori and Watanabe (2022+) for more details.

\arguments{
  \item{return_vector}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{return_vector} here~~
      T x 1 vector (y(1),...,y(T))' of returns where T is a sample size.

  \item{nBurn}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{nBurn} here~~
Number of iterations for the burn-in period. Default value is the maximum integer less than or equal to 2*sqrt(nSim)+1.
}
  \item{vHyper}{
8 x 1 vector of hyperparameters. (mu_0,sigma_0^2,a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1,n_0,S_0). Default values are (0,1000, 1,1,1,1,0.01,0.01).

\value{ A list with components:
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
  \item{vmu}{nSim x 1 vector of MCMC samples of mu}
  \item{vphi}{nSim x 1 vector of MCMC samples of phi}
  \item{vsigma_eta}{nSim x 1 vector of MCMC samples of sigma_eta}
  \item{vrho}{nSim x 1 vector of MCMC samples of rho}
  \item{mh}{nSim x T matrix of latent log volatilities (h(1),...,h(T)). For example, the first column is a vector of MCMC samples for h(1).}
  Further, the acceptance rates of MH algorithms will be shown for h and (mu,phi,sigma_eta, rho).
